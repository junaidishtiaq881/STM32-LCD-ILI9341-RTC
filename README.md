# STM32-LCD-ILI9341-RTC
In this project, I have interfaced a an external RTC with STM32-NUCLEOL496 and display a real-world time on LCD ILI9341.
I have created a MENU on LCD and used an encoder to select the menu and navigate it by rotating and select the menu by pressing an encoder button. 
By entering to the SET RTC TIME, I have select the time by navigating the Hours, Minutes and Seconds.
